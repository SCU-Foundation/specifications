# Lattice Certification & Safety Layer (LCSL) Specification v1.0

**Status:** Stable Specification  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Certification & Safety Layer Specification defines the technical implementation substrate of the LCSL Standard.  
It specifies metadata formats, attestation fields, provenance schemas, domain transition structures, capability declarations, version floor enforcement, and update sequencing algorithms.

LCSL‑Spec v1.0 provides the technical detail required for interoperable, verifiable, and safe implementations of the LCSL Standard.
