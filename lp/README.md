# Lattice Protocol Specification (LP‑Spec) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Specification  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Protocol Specification (LP‑Spec) defines the **technical, implementation‑agnostic structures** that operationalise the Lattice Protocol Standard (LP v1.0).  
Where LP v1.0 defines the constitutional rules of semantic meaning, LP‑Spec defines the **canonical packet formats, primitive encodings, envelope structures, boundary metadata, and validation rules** that implement those semantics in interoperable systems.

LP‑Spec v1.0 is the foundational semantic specification for all Lattice‑conformant agents, devices, runtimes, and systems.
