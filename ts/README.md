# Trust Stack Specification (TS‑Spec) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Specification  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Trust Stack Specification (TS‑Spec) defines the **technical, implementation‑agnostic structures** that operationalise the Trust Stack Standard (TS v1.0).  
Where TS v1.0 defines the constitutional rules of identity, provenance, safety, and trust, TS‑Spec defines the **canonical metadata structures, envelopes, and state machines** that implement those rules in interoperable systems.

TS‑Spec v1.0 is the foundational technical specification for all other Lattice specifications.
