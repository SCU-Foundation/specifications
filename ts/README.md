# Trust Stack Specification (TS‑Spec) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Specification  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Trust Stack Specification (TS‑Spec) defines the technical, implementation‑agnostic structures that operationalise the Trust Stack Standard (TS v1.0).  
Where TS v1.0 defines the constitutional rules of identity, provenance, safety, and trust, TS‑Spec defines the canonical metadata structures, envelopes, and state machines that implement those rules in interoperable systems.

TS‑Spec v1.0 is the foundational technical specification for all other Lattice specifications.

## Governance

TS‑Spec is stewarded by the SCU Foundation, the neutral, non‑commercial standards body responsible for maintaining canonical specifications, versioning, and long‑term governance.

Trust research, provenance modelling, and standards‑adjacent proposals are conducted by the Lattice Research Institute (LRI).

All changes MUST follow the SCU Foundation’s governed change‑management process.
