# Lattice Web Specification (LW‑Spec) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Specification  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Web Specification (LW‑Spec) defines the technical, implementation‑agnostic structures that operationalise the Lattice Web Standard (LW v1.0).  
Where LW v1.0 defines the constitutional rules of graph‑level semantic structure, LW‑Spec defines the canonical graph schemas, node and edge encodings, graph envelopes, boundary metadata, and validation rules that implement those rules in interoperable systems.

LW‑Spec v1.0 is the foundational graph‑level specification for all Lattice‑conformant agents, devices, runtimes, and systems.

## Governance

LW‑Spec is stewarded by the SCU Foundation, the neutral, non‑commercial standards body responsible for maintaining canonical specifications, versioning, and long‑term governance.

Graph‑level research, semantic‑web modelling, and standards‑adjacent proposals are conducted by the Lattice Research Institute (LRI).

All changes MUST follow the SCU Foundation’s governed change‑management process.
