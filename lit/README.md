# Lattice Identity Token Specification (LIT‑Spec) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Specification  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Identity Token Specification (LIT‑Spec) defines the **technical, implementation‑agnostic structures** that operationalise the Lattice Identity Token Standard (LIT v1.0).  
Where LIT v1.0 defines the constitutional rules of identity, provenance, attestation, boundaries, and revocation, LIT‑Spec defines the **canonical token format, identity metadata structures, attestation schemas, revocation metadata, and validation rules** that implement those rules in interoperable systems.

LIT‑Spec v1.0 is the foundational identity specification for all Lattice‑conformant agents, devices, runtimes, and systems.
