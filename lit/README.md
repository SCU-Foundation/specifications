# Lattice Identity Token Specification (LIT‑Spec) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Specification  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Identity Token Specification (LIT‑Spec) defines the technical, implementation‑agnostic structures that operationalise the Lattice Identity Token Standard (LIT v1.0).  
Where LIT v1.0 defines the constitutional rules of identity, provenance, attestation, boundaries, and revocation, LIT‑Spec defines the canonical token format, identity metadata structures, attestation schemas, revocation metadata, and validation rules that implement those rules in interoperable systems.

LIT‑Spec v1.0 is the foundational identity specification for all Lattice‑conformant agents, devices, runtimes, and systems.
