# Governance — Lattice Identity Token Specification (LLIT‑Spec)

**Specification:** Lattice Identity Token Specification (LIT‑Spec)  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)  
**Repository:** REPO: Specifications — /specifications/lit/

---

## Purpose

This document defines the governance model for LIT‑Spec.  
All governance authority flows from the SCU Foundation, the neutral, non‑commercial steward of the Lattice ecosystem.

---

## Governance Authority

The SCU Foundation:

- maintains canonical specifications and architecture  
- ensures long‑term neutrality and stability  
- enforces identity, provenance, attestation, safety, and boundary rules  
- approves or rejects changes  
- maintains canonical repository structure  
- ensures alignment with Repo‑Map vE1.2 and GRM vE1.1  

The Lattice Research Institute (LRI):

- conducts identity, provenance, and attestation research  
- supports interpretability and standards‑adjacent work  
- provides non‑binding research input  

---

## Decision‑Making

Governance follows:

- REPO: Governance — /governance-charter.md  
- REPO: Governance — /change-management-charter.md  
- REPO: Governance — /safety-governance.md  

These define decision authority, approval processes, safety enforcement, and update sequencing.

---

## Change‑Management

All changes MUST follow:

1. proposal submission  
2. governance review  
3. identity, provenance, attestation, and safety evaluation  
4. structural and canonical alignment check  
5. approval or rejection  
6. versioning and documentation updates  
7. governed merge sequencing  

No changes may bypass this process.

---

## Prohibited Governance Actions

- redefining governance authority  
- bypassing change‑management  
- introducing proprietary or commercial influence  
- altering identity, provenance, attestation, safety, or boundary rules  
- modifying canonical structure without approval
