# Lattice Meta Specification (LM‑Spec) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Specification  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Meta Specification (LM‑Spec) defines the **technical, implementation‑agnostic structures** that operationalise the Lattice Meta Standard (LM v1.0).  
Where LM v1.0 defines the constitutional rules of contextual meaning, alignment, and cross‑domain coherence, LM‑Spec defines the **canonical metadata structures, contextual envelopes, alignment schemas, and validation rules** that implement those rules in interoperable systems.

LM‑Spec v1.0 is the foundational meta‑semantic specification for all Lattice‑conformant agents, devices, runtimes, and systems.
