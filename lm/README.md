# Lattice Meta Specification (LM‑Spec) v1.0

**Status:** Draft Specification  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Steward:** SCU Foundation  
**Research Body:** Lattice Research Institute (LRI)

The Lattice Meta Specification (LM‑Spec) defines the technical, implementation‑agnostic structures that operationalise the Lattice Meta Standard (LM v1.0).  
Where LM v1.0 defines the constitutional rules of contextual meaning, alignment, and cross‑domain coherence, LM‑Spec defines the canonical metadata structures, contextual envelopes, alignment schemas, and validation rules that implement those rules in interoperable systems.

LM‑Spec v1.0 is the foundational meta‑semantic specification for all Lattice‑conformant agents, devices, runtimes, and systems.

## Governance

LM‑Spec is stewarded by the SCU Foundation, the neutral, non‑commercial standards body responsible for maintaining canonical specifications, versioning, and long‑term governance.

Meta‑semantic research, contextual modelling, and standards‑adjacent proposals are conducted by the Lattice Research Institute (LRI).

All changes MUST follow the SCU Foundation’s governed change‑management process.
